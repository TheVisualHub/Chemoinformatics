🔭🐍 Fresh code - Royal Gamble Lite - unfolding novel drug spaces guided by the principles of star formation. ✨ 

# 🔬 Welcome to the Chemoinformatics repository 

This repository contains custom-made Python scripts, designed for:

- 🔄 Molecular format conversion (example SMILES →  SDF or PDB) with **geometry optimization**  
-  💊 Designing drug-like molecules ready for docking and virtual screening

Most scripts utilize the **RDKit** package — install it easily with:

```bash
pip install rdkit
