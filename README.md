By blending stochastic principles with cheminformatics expertise, these Python scripts empower researchers to discover and design molecules that are both scientifically rigorous and creatively inspired—ready for downstream applications like docking and virtual screening. This repository contains custom-made algorithms, designed for:

🔄 Molecular format conversion (example SMILES →  SDF or PDB) with **geometry optimization**  
💊 Designing drug-like molecules ready for docking and virtual screening

Most scripts utilize the **RDKit** package — install it easily with:

```bash
pip install rdkit
```


# 🎲 Harnessing the Principles of Stochasticity

The scripts for small molecule construction leverage a "Casino-style" approach that introduces controlled randomness into the selection of building blocks (e.g., chemical rings). This strategy mimics decision-making processes found in casino games, where calculated risks and conservative moves are balanced to optimize outcomes. A key feature is the inclusion of a "bluff" boost, an intentional injection of variability that breaks predictability and fosters creative, dynamic molecular designs. This approach enables the exploration of novel chemical spaces by subtly pushing beyond standard combinatorial methods, ultimately generating unique, drug-like molecules with enhanced structural diversity.
